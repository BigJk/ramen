**ramen** is a simple console emulator written in go that can be used to create various ascii / text (roguelike) games. It's based on the great **[ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten)** library and inspired by libraries like **[libtcod](https://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod/wiki/Features)**.

**Warning:** This is still a early version so api and features are not fixed yet
